# Scripts

A series of scripts that I wrote:
- `backup` and relative systemd units to automate restic backups
- `android-music-sync` to sync a music playlist on an Android device
- `ghclone` to automate cloning GitHub repositories
- `writeimg` to create bootable USB sticks
- `g` to search its arguments on Google

Also a couple of configuration files:
- my `.zshrc`
- my i3 configuration files
